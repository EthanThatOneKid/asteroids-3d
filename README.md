# Asteroids 3d ðŸŽ±
> A game that takes Asteroids to a 2.5D realm.

## About â˜„
I created this game after being inspired by a Coding Train video that explained how to make the classic Asteroids arcade game in Processing.
My spin on the game was that it added layers to the game; instead of one layer of asteroids approaching, there are three.
The goal is to clear out all the ateroids on all the layers.

## How to Play ðŸŽ®
To play, rotate the ship using the right and left arrow keys on the keyboard.
Thrust forwards using the upwards arrow key on the keyboard.
Press *Z* to go down one layer and press *X* to go up one layer.
Press the space bar to shoot a laser at an asteroid.
Upon winning or losing, refresh the page to start again.

## The Three Layers ðŸ˜µ
Green asteroids are found on the top-most layer, purple asteroids are found in the middle layer, and blue asteroids are found in the bottom-most layer.

## Development ðŸ’»
